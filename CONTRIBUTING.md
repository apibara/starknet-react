## How to contribute to Starknet React

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/starknet-start/starknet-start/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/starknet-start/starknet-start/issues/new). Be sure to include a**title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a**code sample** or an**executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
* Make sure your patch applies cleanly to the `main` branch. It's a good idea to `git rebase main` before opening the Pull Request.
* The commit style used by Starknet React follows this pattern: `<package>: <commit message>`. For example, `core: change useAccount hook to...`.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Starknet React will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Starknet React [in the Discord community](https://discord.gg/m7B92CNFNt).

#### **Do you want to contribute to the Starknet React documentation?**

* For small changes feel free to open a GitHub pull request with the patch.
* For larger changes, please discuss the changes with the team before working on it.
