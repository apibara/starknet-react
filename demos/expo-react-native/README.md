# Starknet React + Expo + React Native

This demo shows how to build a mobile dapp using [Expo](https://expo.dev/) and
[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). The UI framework used is
[Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev/).

## Getting started

Expo doesn't work well with `pnpm`, so this demo is a separate project that
uses `npm`.

**Install dependencies**

Install the project's dependencies with `npm install`.

**Start dev server**

At the moment, the project focuses on a mobile web environment. Start the
development server with `npm run web -c`.

**Edit code**

You can edit the application's code and it will reload automatically.
