# Upgrading to V3 [Upgrading to Starknet React V3]

## Overview

Starknet React V3 is a major revision of Starknet React, as such you should expect breaking changes.

### Update Starknet.js to v6

The required version of Starknet.js is v6. Starknet React will simply not work with v5.

### `useContract`

This hook now returns a _typed_ contract, that is a contract that uses the provided ABI to provide type-safety.

The following example shows a smart contract with a type-safe `transfer` function.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import { type Abi } from "starknet";
import { useContract, useNetwork } from "@starknet-react/core";

const abi = [
  {
    type: "function",
    name: "transfer",
    state_mutability: "external",
    inputs: [
      {
        name: "recipient",
        type: "core::starknet::contract_address::ContractAddress",
      },
      {
        name: "amount",
        type: "core::integer::u256",
      },
    ],
    outputs: [],
  },
] as const satisfies Abi;

const { chain } = useNetwork();
const { contract } = useContract({
  abi,
  address: chain.nativeCurrency.address,
});

// Complete function name
contract.populate("t
//                  ^|

// Argument types is also inferred
contract.populate("transfer", ["0x0", 1n])
```

### `useContractRead`

The hook is now called `useReadContract`. Notice that the hook is now type-safe:
it will use the provided ABI to automatically parse the call arguments and
response. If you are using Typescript, the autocomplete should also automatically
complete `functionName`, the input parameters and the output data.

This hook requires a contract ABI generated by a recent version of the Cairo compiler.
If you are interacting with an old contract, you should manually write the ABI spec
or use a tool to automatically upgrade the ABI.

If you want the old (untyped) behavior, use the new `useCall` hook.

### `useContractWrite`

The hook is now called `useSendTransaction`.  The hook expects a list of
`Call`s, you can use the new typed contract together with its `populate` method
to create the list of calls.

### `useWaitForTransaction`

This hook is now called `useTransactionReceipt`.
