# Paymaster Providers

You need to configure a Paymaster RPC provider to allow your dapp to execute gasless/gasfree transaction to
Starknet.

Starknet React paymaster providers are factories that, given a chain, return a Starknet.js
`PaymasterInterface` object.

## Providers

This section provides an alphabetical list of Paymaster RPC Providers supported by
Starknet React.

### Public

Starknet React ships with a public provider that you can use to run **Gasless** transactions.
For any project that needs **Gasfree** transaction, you should configure an *api key* to one
of the providers below.

At the moment, this provider uses the free Paymaster RPC endpoints provided by:

 - AVNU

### AVNU

Create an AVNU API key from the dashboard(soon available - contact AVNU team until available).

```ts twoslash
import { avnuPaymasterProvider } from "@starknet-react/core";

const apiKey = "your-api-key";
const provider = avnuPaymasterProvider({ apiKey });
```

### Cartridge Paymaster

Cartridge Paymaster is natively supported in the [Controller](https://docs.cartridge.gg/controller/overview) and requires no additional configuration.
Transactions that match a Paymaster policy (indicating a contract address and entrypoint) will automatically be subsidized.
Paymaster policies and budgets can be [managed through the Slot CLI](https://docs.cartridge.gg/slot/paymaster).
