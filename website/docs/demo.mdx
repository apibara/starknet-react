# StarkNet React Demo

This demo shows how to combine the hooks provided by StarkNet React to
build React applications.

import { Demo } from '../src/components/Demo'

The demo interacts with a simple smart contract deployed on StarkNet GÃ¶rli Testnet.
You can find the contract [on Voyager](https://goerli.voyager.online/contract/0x036486801b8f42e950824cba55b2df8cccb0af2497992f807a7e1d9abd2c6ba1).

:::info

If you try to invoke the `incrementCounter` method without first connecting a StarkNet wallet,
the transaction will fail instantly.
