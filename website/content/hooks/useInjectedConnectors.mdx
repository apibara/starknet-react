## Usage

```ts
import {
  StarknetConfig,
  publicProvider,
  argent,
  braavos,
  useInjectedConnectors,
} from "@starknet-react/core";

export default function App({ children }) {
  const chains = [goerli, mainnet];
  const provider = publicProvider();
  const { connectors } = useInjectedConnectors({
    // Show these connectors if the user has no connector installed.
    recommended: [
      argent(),
      braavos(),
    ],
    // Hide recommended connectors if the user has any connector installed.
    includeRecommended: "onlyIfNoConnectors",
    // Randomize the order of the connectors.
    order: "random"
  });

  return (
    <StarknetConfig
      chains={chains}
      provider={provider}
      connectors={connectors}
    >
      {children}
    </StarknetConfig>
  );
}
```

## Options

 * __recommended?__`: Connector[]`
   - List of recommended connectors.

 * __includeRecommended?__`: "always" | "onlyIfNoConnectors"`
   - If `"always"`, the hook always returns the recommended connectors.
   - If `"onlyIfNoConnectors"`, the recommended connectors are included only if
     no other connector is installed.

 * __order?__`: "random" | "alphabetical"`
   - Control the order in which connectors are returned.
   - If `"random"`, connectors are shuffled.
   - If `"alphabetical"`, connectors are alphabetically sorted by their id.

## Returns

 * __connectors__`: Connector[]`
   - Contains the list of injected connectors installed by the user.
   - All connectors are unique and sorted.
