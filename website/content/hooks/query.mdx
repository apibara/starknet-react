A query hook is a function that allows you to fetch data on the Network.

The query hook type provides a set of return values and options that can be used to control and monitor the status of the data fetching operation.
In addition to common options and returns, each query hook introduces its own unique set of options and returns.

You can find more details in the [TanStack Query documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/react/reference/useQuery).

## Options
 * __refetchInterval?__`: number | false | ((query: Query) => number | false) | undefined`
    - Frequency at which to refetch data.
 * __enabled?__`: boolean`
    - If false, disables the query.
 * __retry?__`: boolean | number | (failureCount: number, error: TError) => boolean`
    - If false, failed queries will not be retried.
    - If true, failed queries will always be retried.
    - If set to a number, failed queries will be retried the specified number of times.
    - If set to a callback, the callback will control whether the query is retried or not.
 * __retryDelay__`: number | (retryAttempt: number, error: TError) => number`
    - Specify the delay to apply before retrying the query.

## Returns
 * __error?__`: TError`
    - The error if the query was not successful.
 * __refetch__`: (options: { throwOnError: boolean, cancelRefetch: boolean }) => Promise<UseQueryResult>`
    - Manually refetch data.
 * __status__`: string`
    - `pending` if there's no cached data and no query attempt was finished yet.
    - `error` if the query attempt resulted in an error.
    - `success` if the query has received a response with no errors and is ready to display its data.
 * __fetchStatus__`: string`
    - `fetching` if the query is executing.
    - `paused` if the query wanted to fetch, but has been paused.
    - `idle` if the query is not fetching.
