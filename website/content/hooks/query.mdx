A query hook is a function that allows you to fetch data on the Network.

The query hook type provides a set of return values and options that can be used to control and monitor the status of the data fetching operation.
In addition to common options and returns, each query hook introduces its own unique set of options and returns.

## Options
 * __refetchInterval?__`: number | false | ((data: TData | undefined, query: Query) => number | false)`
    - Frequency at which to refetch data.
 * __enabled?__`: boolean`
    - If false, disables the query.
 * __suspense__`: //TODO ADD SUSPEN TYPE`
    - If true, enable suspense mode.
 * __retry?__`: boolean | number | (failureCount: number, error: TError) => boolean`
    - If false, failed queries will not be retried.
    - If true, failed queries will always be retried.
    - If set to a number, failed queries will be retried the specified number of times.
    - If set to a callback, the callback will control whether the query is retried or not.
 * __retryDelay__`: number | (retryAttempt: number, error: TError) => number`
    - Specify the delay to apply before retrying the query.

## Returns
 * __error?__`: TError`
    - The error if the query was not successful.
 * __refetch__`: (options: { throwOnError: boolean, cancelRefetch: boolean }) => Promise<UseQueryResult>`
    - Manually refetch data.
 * __isSuccess?__`: boolean`
    - If true, the query was successful.
 * __isError?__`: boolean`
    - If true, the query was not successful.
 * __isIdle?__`: boolean`
    - If true, the query is not fetching.
 * __isLoading?__`: boolean`
    - If true, the query is fetching.
 * __status__`: "idle" | "loading" | "success" |" error"`
