Hook to fetch an account's balance.

By default, the hook fetches the balance for the chain's native token.

## Usage

```tsx
import { useBalance, useAccount } from "@starknet-react/core";

export function App() {
  const { address } = useAccount();

  const { data } = useBalance({ address, watch: true });

  return <div>{data.formatted}</div>;
}
```

## Options

 * `token?: string`
   - The ERC20 contract's address. Defaults to the native token.
 * `address?: string`
   - The target address.
   - If the value is undefined, no call is made.
 * `watch?: boolean`
   - If true, refresh the balance at every block.
 * `enabled?: boolean`
   - From TanStack Query.
   - If false, disables the query.
 * `refetchInterval?: number | false | ((data: TData | undefined, query: Query) => number | false)`
   - From TanStack Query.
   - Frequency at which to refetch data.
 * `suspense`
   - From TanStack Query.
   - If true, enable suspense mode.
 * `retry?: boolean | number | (failureCount: number, error: TError) => boolean`
   - From TanStack Query.
   - If false, failed queries will not be retried.
   - If true, failed queries will always be retried.
   - If set to a number, failed queries will be retried the specified number of
     times.
   - If set to a callback, the callback will control whether the query is
     retried or not.
 * `retryDelay: number | (retryAttempt: number, error: TError) => number`
   - From TanStack Query.
   - Specify the delay to apply before retrying the query.

## Returns

 * `data?: { decimals: number, symbol: string, formatted: string, value: bigint }`
   - The address' balance.
   - `decimals` is the number of ERC20 decimals.

   - `formatted` is the formatted balance.
   - `value` is the raw balance.
 * `error?: TError`

 * `refetch: (options: { throwOnError: boolean, cancelRefetch: boolean }) => Promise<UseQueryResult>`
   - From TanStack Query.
   - Manually refetch data.
 * `isSuccess?: boolean`
   - From TanStack Query.
   - If true, the query was successful.
 * `isError?: boolean`
