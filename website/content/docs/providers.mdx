You need to configure an RPC provider to allow your dapp to fetch data from
Starknet.

Starknet React providers are factories that, given a chain, return a Starknet.js
`ProviderInterface` object.

## Providers

This section provides an alphabetical list of RPC Providers supported by
Starknet React.

### Public

Starknet React ships with a public provider that you can use for quick demos.
This provider is kindly provided by [Lava network](https://www.lavanet.xyz/).
For any project that makes more than an handful of requests, you should use one
of the providers below.

### JSON-RPC

This is generic RPC provider. Use it to connect to private endpoints or to
services not yet supported by Starknet React.

```tsx
import { Chain, jsonRpcProvider } from "@starknet-react/core";

function rpc(chain: Chain) {
  return {
    http: `https://${chain.network}.example.org`
  }
}

const provider = jsonRpcProvider({ rpc });
```

### Alchemy

Create an Alchemy API key from the dashboard.

```ts
import { alchemyProvider } from "@starknet-react/core";

const provider = alchemyProvider({ apiKey });
```

### Infura

Create an Infura API key from the dashboard.

```ts
import { infuraProvider } from "@starknet-react/core";

const provider = infuraProvider({ apiKey });
```

### Lava

Create a Lava API key from the dashboard.

```ts
import { lavaProvider } from "@starknet-react/core";
