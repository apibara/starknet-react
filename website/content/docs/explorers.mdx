The `StarknetConfig` provider accepts an optional `explorer` property to
configure the block explorer used by the `useExplorer` hook.

Starknet React ships with the following block explorers (in alphabetical order):

 - Stark Compass
 - Starkscan
 - Viewblock
 - Voyager

## The `Explorer` interface

The `Explorer` interface is used to generate links to the block explorer.
It provides the following properties and methods.

 - `name: string`: human-friendly explorer name.
 - `block({ hash?: string, number?: number }): string`: link to the specified
   block, either by hash or number.
 - `transaction(hash: string): string`: link to the specified transaction.
 - `contract(address: string): string`: link to the specified contract.
 - `class(hash: string): string`: link to the specified class.

## Explorer factory

`StarknetConfig` expects an __explorer factory__, that is a function with the
following signature:

```ts

type ExplorerFactory<T extends Explorer = Explorer> = (
  chain: Chain,
) => T | null;
```

Starknet React ships with the following explorer factories:

 - `starkcompass`
 - `starkscan`
 - `viewblock`
 - `voyager`
