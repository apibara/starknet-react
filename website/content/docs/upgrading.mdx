title: Upgrading from V1
priority: 10
---

This guide will help you upgrade from Starknet React V1.

## Updating dependencies

First, update all dependencies and double check that the installed version of
`@starknet-react/core` is at least `2.0.0`.

<CH.Code>
```console npm
npm install @starknet-react/chains@next @starknet-react/core@next starknet get-starknet-core
```
```console pnpm
pnpm add @starknet-react/chains@next @starknet-react/core@next starknet get-starknet-core
```
```console yarn
yarn add @starknet-react/chains@next @starknet-react/core@next starknet get-starknet-core
```
</CH.Code>

## Update `StarknetConfig`

Update the existing `StarknetConfig` by adding the new `chains` and `provider`
options. You also need to update the `connectors` passed to it.

 - `chains`: a list of chains supported by your dapp. The first chain in the
   list is the default chain, used when the user doesn't connect their wallet.
 - `provider`: an RPC provider. See the [providers](/docs/providers) section
   for more information.
 - `connectors`: in v2, basic information about a wallet (like the id and name)
   must be provided. Starknet React provides helpers to initialize connectors
   for the most popular wallets.

```tsx components/starknet-provider.tsx
import { goerli } from "@starknet-react/chains";
import {
  StarknetConfig,
  publicProvider,
  argent,
  braavos,
} from "@starknet-react/core";

export function StarknetProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const chains = [goerli];
  const provider = publicProvider();
  const connectors = [argent(), braavos()];

  return (
    <StarknetConfig
      chains={chains}
      provider={provider}
      connectors={connectors}
    >
      {children}
    </StarknetConfig>
  );
}
```

## Transaction manager

The transaction manager is now gone ðŸ’€
Fear not, it's easy to replace it using standard React tools ðŸ˜‡

This decision was not easy, but we noticed that the hook and context were cause
of some issues and many teams decided to implement their own solution using
their favourite state management library.

The easiest way to upgrade is by following the code in the [transaction manager
demo](/demos/transaction-manager). Once you finish upgrading, you will have a
transaction manager that's easier to customize and that persists the transaction
list between page reloads.
