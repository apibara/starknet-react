Connectors are used to _connect_ the user's wallet to your dapp.
If you dapp requires the user to submit a transaction or sign a message,
you must provide a list of supported wallets to Starknet React.

## Connectors

This in an alphabetical list of connectors supported by Starknet React.

### Injected Connector

An _injected connector_ is a wallet that injects itself in the web page. This
type of wallets are also known as _"browser wallets"_.

Configure a new injected wallet with the following properties:

 - `id` (required): unique wallet id, used when injecting the wallet in the web page.
 - `name` (optional): human friendly name.
 - `icon` (optional): wallet icons, for both light and dark mode. Icons should be base 64
   encoded svg images that developers can use as `src` properties on an `img`
   HTML tag.

### `useInjectedConnectors`

Starknet React provides the `useInjectedConnectors` hook to discover injected
wallets automatically. You can read more about this hook [in the
documentation](/hooks/useInjectedConnectors).

### Argent X

The Argent X wallet is supported out of the box.

```tsx
import { argent } from "@starknet-react/core";

const connectors = [
  argent()
];
```

### Braavos

The Braavos wallet is supported out of the box.

```tsx
import { braavos } from "@starknet-react/core";

const connectors = [
  braavos()
];
```
