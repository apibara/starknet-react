## The `useBalance` hook

The `useBalance` hook is used to fetch an ERC20 token balance.
This hook accepts three arguments:

 - `address`: the account address for which we want to check the balance.
 - `token` (optional): the ERC20 contract address. If no token is provided,
 the hook will look up the balance for the network's native currency.
 - `watch` (optional): refresh data at every block.

```tsx
const { data, error, isLoading } = useBalance({
  address,
  watch: true,
});
```

The `data` returned by the hook can be formatted as follows:

```tsx
<p>Balance: {data.formatted} {data.symbol}</p>
```
