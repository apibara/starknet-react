# Connectors

StarkNet React requires a list of connectors to know which wallets are supported by the app.
Connectors are specified when creating the StarkNet
context using the `StarknetConfig` component.

```typescript
const connectors = [
  /* create connectors */
]

return (
  <StarknetConfig connectors={connectors}>
    <MyComponent />
  </StarknetConfig>
)
```

## The Connector interface

The `Connector` interface provides the following methods:

- `available(): boolean`: returns true if the connector is available, i.e. the user has the wallet installed.
- `ready(): Promise<boolean>`: returns true if the wallet is available and already authorized to connect.
- `connect(): Promise<AccountInterface>`: connect the wallet.
- `disconnect(): Promise<void>`: disconnect the wallet.
- `account(): Promise<AccountInterface | null>`: returns the current wallet account, if any.

## Injected Connector

At the moment, the only supported type of connector is the `InjectedConnector` used to support browser wallets.

Create a new injected connector by specifying the wallet's `id`.

```typescript
const connector = new InjectedConnector({
  options: { id },
})
```

The wallet ids are the following (in alphabetical order):

- ArgentX: `argentX`
- Braavos: `braavos`

## Automatic detection of installed wallets

The library provides a function to automatically detect the browser wallets installed by the user.

```typescript
import { getInstalledInjectedConnectors } from '@starknet-react/core'

const connectors = getInstalledInjectedConnectors()
```

This function is available for convenience but **its use is not recommended** for the following reasons:

- The wallets object can be injected in the page context at any arbitrary point in time after the page renders. Oftentimes the function does not detect any wallet because it's run before any wallet is injected.
- It breaks server side rendering (SSR). Components that use this function will render differently on the server (where no wallet is available) and the client, resulting in an SSR error during development.
